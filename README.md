# General Information
## About
<p align="justify">
This game was created as part of a project for an assessment. It was supposed to fit the theme of "games for change," but it didn’t fully meet that goal. In the game, you play as a noble character with a special sword that can cast fireballs. The game includes various challenging obstacles like falling platforms, fire traps, spike heads, arrow traps, spikes, and goblins. These obstacles make the game more difficult and keep it interesting.

Additionally, post-processing effects such as bloom, lighting, and shadows improve the visual quality. Light plays an important role in the game’s atmosphere. If only I had finished the game...

## Objective
<p align="justify">
  The objective of the game is to go to the end of the game, watch out for traps (Faling platforms, Fire traps, Spike heads, Arrow traps, Spikes), and kill goblins in order to reach the end.

## Story
<p align="justify">
</p>
Here’s a shorter version of the storyline:

In the kingdom of Kha'ala, a noble warrior named Poro wields a legendary sword that casts fireballs. When a dark curse spreads, turning creatures into monsters and filling the land with deadly traps, Poro must find the ancient Emberstone to lift the curse.

Facing goblins, dangerous traps, and treacherous lands, Poro’s bravery and skill are the kingdom’s last hope. Will he find the Emberstone and save Kha'ala in time?
